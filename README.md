How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  With any project it is important to test your code. The very simplists way to check your code is to verify it works. After you have decided your code works and the program/app runs the way you want the next step is to look fror errors in your build comments. Even though the code may run, it may have errors that may prevent a .dll or class to not work properly. Once you have tested and looked at those items. The next step is to use Junit testing to verify the code you wrote is meeting requirements laid out by the client or manager. This is a great way to remove yourself from the testing process and allow for a third party to test your code.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  User needs is usually defined by a set of requirements. Those requirements may be simple to understand and may require some specific code and some may be simple requests that are not coding specific. An example of a requirement which is common would be format of entered data into fields. They may want the date in a specific format. That type of requirement may need to have a special class or library to use. This was used in Project 1 in the appointment.java test.
How do I approach designing software?
  Designing software starts with an idea. Regardless of who the "client" is, if it is yourself or a paying client. You should follow the same format. Understand the requirements, research the type of program needed, review apis/libraries needed, code, review code, test code, update code, test code, release app or program.
